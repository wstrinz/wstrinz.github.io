      ## Overview

      When I came to Bendyworks, there were a few people who made an effort to pass on what they'd learned about consulting. I've come to rely on a lot of it since then,
      rejected some of it, and forgotten a lot.

      I'm hoping to do a knowledge-dump / brain drain / ![mind meld](http://orig02.deviantart.net/2495/f/2015/237/1/8/star_trek_spock_kirk_t_hy_la_mind_meld__forget__by_ukuleleworld-d976lkz.gif)mind meld some of it here.

      ## TL:DR

      **We are both craftspeople**

      <img src="http://leanmagazine.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/swcraftmanship-smaller-web.jpg" width=400>

      ** _and_ service industry workers **

      <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MW9_MgiLPa4/maxresdefault.jpg" width="400">

      But we aren't that robot; we built it.

      The hard balancing act is keeping the client happy while, as our motto says, sharing joy and success in our craft (?)

      But we aren't that robit; **we built that robit**.

      We can make our drive through building clients happy, while at the same time making cool drive through robots that handle orders and have snappy comebacks to annoying kids that get a hold of the headset frequency.

      # So, How Do?

      ##  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

      But I do have a couple of aphorisms and words to live by I've used these past couple of years

      ---

      ### Yes, and
      > Client: Let's make and AI that tells me how much twitter dollars my tweets make.
      > > **No, but**: Twitter really, really doesn't work that way
      > vs
      > > **Yes, and**: Social media analytics is complicated, but there's a few easy measures of your outreach we can tap into, and with enough resources we could gain a lot finer grained understanding of your reach

      More realistically

      > Client: Lets cache all the data from our sensors. Except only when it doesn't change. And when it does change bust the cache
      > > Us: Ok, so, that's going to be a bit tricky...

      **Lesson**: aim for "Yes, and", but if something doesn't make sense, explain yourself slowly and carefully, and make sure the client's questions are answered.

      ### Communications
      - Tune your irritation and confusion detectors way up
        - When the go all dingy, be extra calm, explain slowly, and above all don't get frustrated.
        - If it helps, be Jeeves

      ## Communications
      - At least at the start, say more than you need to.
        - Don't waste a client's time, but try to offset the intrinsic information loss of text with your own clarification

      ## Emotions
      - people are human, and its like... weird.
      - But the client will be pleased if they feel like you understood them and provided meaningful feedback.

      - A good way to do this is to be right about everything all the time and explain yourself with the perfect mix of humility and erudition.

      Since we're all human, some tips

      ---

      ---

      ### Contextualize beliefs and statements
      - Take time to bracket claims with "from what I can tell based on the current test suite, X is fine", or "my best guess based on (last time this happened) is the X was caused by Y"
      - vs "X is fine" or "Y caused X"
      - **But**...

      - vs "X is fine" or "Y caused X"
      - **But**...

      ### Model the client
      - Use the empathy chip in your brain; if I were in this person's situaton, what would I want? how would I feel.
      - This is **hard**, and sometimes requires stepping back. Often when we talk to people we turn off the empathy chip because the talking chip takes up too much power.

      ### Use your midwestern superpowers to your advantage
      - To quote _Wizard People, Dear Reader_'s version of Harry Potter
      > Subtlety and patience can be a great way of looking pretty cool.

      - Not saying to lie about your abilities or be overly self effacing; but many people notice and value being direct and forthright
