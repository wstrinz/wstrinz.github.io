# Consulting

class: center, middle

## Things wot I have learned.

name: summary

## Overview

When I came to Bendyworks, there were a few people who made an effort to pass on what they'd learned about consulting.

I've come to rely on a lot of it since then, rejected some of it, and forgotten a lot.

## Overview

For this quick presentation, I'm hoping start up the knowledge-dumps / brain drains /

# So, How Do?

##  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

##  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

But I do have a couple of tips and aphorisms that've helped me.

## #1 Goal: Make client happy
- Use social and technical methods

## Yes, and

When people ask for crazy things, the urge is to say **"No, we can't, but..."**.

When you can, try to say **"Yes, we can do that and we'll need a squad of highly trained mercenaries."** instead.

When you can, try to say **"Yes, we can do that and ~~we'll need a squad of highly trained mercenaries~~ it'll be best if we tweak things a bit from the original pitch."** instead.

**So**: aim for "Yes, and", but if something doesn't make sense, explain yourself slowly and carefully, and make sure the client's questions are answered.

## Communications
- Tune your irritation and confusion detectors way up
  - When the go all dingy, be extra calm, explain slowly, and above all don't get frustrated.
  - If it helps, be Jeeves

Talking

## Communications
- At least at the start, say more than you need to.
  - Don't waste a client's time, but try to offset the intrinsic information loss of text with your own clarification

---
## Emotions
- people are human, and its like... weird.

## Emotions
- people are human, and its like... weird.
- But the client will be pleased if they feel like you understood them and provided meaningful feedback.

# So, How Do?
## Emotions
Since we're all human, some tips

---

---

### Contextualize beliefs and statements
- Take time to bracket claims with "from what I can tell based on the current test suite, X is fine", or "my best guess based on (last time this happened) is the X was caused by Y"
- vs "X is fine" or "Y caused X"
- **But**...

- vs "X is fine" or "Y caused X"
- **But**...

### Model the client
- Use the empathy chip in your brain; if I were in this person's situaton, what would I want? how would I feel.
- This is **hard**, and sometimes requires stepping back. Often when we talk to people we turn off the empathy chip because the talking chip takes up too much power.

### Use your midwestern superpowers to your advantage
- To quote _Wizard People, Dear Reader_'s version of Harry Potter
> Subtlety and patience can be a great way of looking pretty cool.

- Not saying to lie about your abilities or be overly self effacing; but many people notice and value being direct and forthright
